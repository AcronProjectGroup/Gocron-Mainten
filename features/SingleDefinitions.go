It's written using a C-style syntax, has statically typed variables, manages memory using garbage collection, and is compiled into stand-alone executables. Go is noted for the concurrent programming features built into the language core, the networking packages in the standard library (such as a web server), fast compilation and execution speed. Its simple, minimalistic and consistent language design make for a delightful experience, while the abundant and thoughtful tooling addresses traditional problems such as consistent formatting and documentation.
